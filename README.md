Just a really simple decentralized chat made with basic low-level sockets in Java. Very similar to the one in *Head First Java*, except through the command line instead of through a GUI, and with added features (shadowbanning, kicking, nicknames, etc.).

"java Maim" to run the program.

This was a homework project from when I was 16 that stopped working for some reason. I felt the need to update it to make it work. Code's really bad, though.
