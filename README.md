Just a really simple decentralized chat made with basic low-level sockets in Java. Very similar to the one in *Head First Java*, except through the command line instead of through a GUI, and with added features (shadowbanning, kicking, nicknames, etc.). About as hideous as the Pokecomparator code wise, but slightly less. Shows improvement, but one important lesson learned - if you don't plan, your code might work, but it'll look like a dyslexic monkey defecated on the keyboard repeatedly until something compiled correctly. 

Just, uh, run compile and run the Maim class. I'm really just dying to throw anything on here. I'm sure in the future I'll have *real* repos with licenses and the whole 9 yards.
